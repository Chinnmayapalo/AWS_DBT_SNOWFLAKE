📊 DBT Analytics Engineering Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics engineering workflow using dbt (Data Build Tool), following industry best practices for building scalable, modular, and analytics-ready data models.

The goal of this project is to showcase how raw data can be transformed into clean, well-structured analytical models using dbt’s core concepts such as models, sources, tests, and materializations.

🚀 Key Highlights

Structured dbt project following best-practice folder conventions

Clear separation of staging, intermediate, and marts layers

Use of dbt models for SQL-based transformations

Built-in testing and documentation-ready structure

Designed to be easily extensible for production-scale analytics use cases

🛠️ Tech Stack

dbt Core

SQL

Git & GitHub

Data Warehouse (configurable via profiles.yml)

🎯 Use Case

This project is ideal for:

Learning analytics engineering fundamentals
